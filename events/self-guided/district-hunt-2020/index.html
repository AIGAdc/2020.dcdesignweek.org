<p>Game Genius hosts their annual District Hunt to showcase the intersection of play and philanthropy. In 2019 (inaugural year), players celebrated the 100th anniversary of Womenâ€™s Suffrage as they completed an interactive story puzzle through relevant sites in the city. This year, our focus turns to mental health.</p>

<p>For all of 2020, we have been building a mural of clues on our Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/gamegeniusllc">@GameGeniusLLC</a> (also located on our website <a href="https://www.gamegenius.org">here</a>). After registering on EventBrite, the hunt will start on our website, with players needing to enter the correct passcode. Upon entry, players will have the option of choosing a VA or DC game track. Each track will consist of 3 hidden challenges that align with the 3 segments of Mental Health: Feeling, Thinking, and Acting. Clues online will help players identify and navigate to the physical location of these challenges. When players arrive at a location, they will face a number of fun games/puzzles to earn a key. These keys contain cryptic messages that players must combine to solve the final mystery.</p>
